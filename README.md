# Cryptopals

My C++ solutions to the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges, https://cryptopals.com

Optional assignments for the course DD2520 Applied Cryptography at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Spring 2020.

Run the exercise # from the console after compiling the file `ch#.cpp`. Some require inputs, such as keys, plaintexts or encrypted data.

Work in progress!
